####Files needed###

# bed files for each marks to include in the model 
# chromosomes sizes in bp [chrom_size_hg19.txt]
# cellmarkfile table (tab delimited) [cellmarkfiletable.txt]
		cell_name	mark_name	file_name
		cell	DNASE		DNASE.bed
		cell	H3K4me1		H3K4me1.bed

###creating binary bed files###

#ChromHMM.jar > directory of the ChromHMM package 
#~/../chrom_size_hg19.txt > directory of file with chromosome size in bp 
#~/../ChromHMMbed/ > directory of your bed files

java -Xmx4000M -jar ~/../ChromHMM.jar BinarizeBed -center ~/../chrom_size_hg19.txt ~/../ChromHMMbed/ ~/../cellmarkfiletable.txt ~/../[output directory]

###running ChromHMM###

java -Xmx4000M -jar ~/../ChromHMM.jar LearnModel  ~/../[directory containing your binarized files]  ~/../[output directory] [number of state wanted] [assembly]


###ChromHMM generate different output files 

# placenta_7_RefSeqTSS_neighborhood [.svg/.png/.txt]
	distribution of each state 2kb up/downstream of TSS

# placenta_7_RefSeqTES_neighborhood [.svg/.png/.txt]
	distribution of each state 2kb up/downstream of TES

# placenta_7_overlap [.svg/.png/.txt]
	overlap between each state and known genomic features

# placenta_7_expanded.bed
# placenta_7_dense.bed
# placenta_7_segments.bed
	bed files containing genomic coordinates for each state, genome browser tracks 

# transitions_7 [.svg/.png/.txt]
	file recapitulating transition parameter from the models
# emissions_7 [.svg/.png/.txt]
	file recapitulating enrichment for each uploaded marks by state 

# model_7.txt
	file recapitulating model parameters
